Action Items:

We're starting to get into the juicy stuff now!

This week's assignment will be focused on writing
code to collect indicator data from online sources
and storing that inside of our database.

The database we will be using for the SSPI is called
MongoDB---short for huMONGOus DataBase.  By the end
of this project, if all goes according to plan, 
we will have a humongous database of our own.

Online data sources---web APIs---generally return in
either JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or in CSV
(Comma Separated Values) formats.

JSON looks like a python dictionary. Here's an example:

{"country": "Argentina, "year": 2018, 
"indicator": "Deforestation", "value": 15.13}

JSON files can be in lists:

[{"country": "Argentina, "year": 2018, 
"indicator": "Deforestation", "value": 15.13},
{"country": "Austria, "year": 2018, 
"indicator": "Deforestation", "value": 27.14},
{"country": "Australia, "year": 2018, 
"indicator": "Deforestation", "value": 19.43}]

They can also be nested:

x = {"country": {"donor": "Germany", "recipient": "India"}, 
"year": 2018, "indicator": "Foreign Aid", "value": 15.13}

We can access and manipulate values from the JSON object x above
like so:

>>> x["indicator"]
"Foreign Aid"

>>> x["value"]
15.13

>>> x["value"] = 19.31
>>> x["value"]
19.31

>>> x["country"]
{"donor": "Germany", "recipient": "India"}

>>> x["country"]["donor"]
"Germany"

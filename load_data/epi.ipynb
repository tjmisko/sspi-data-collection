You will notice, however, that you can't see any of my data files.  This is not an accident.  GitHub does not like to store large files, so I have `.gitignore`d the contents of the `bulk_data` folder. What this means is that git will not keep track of the contents of this folder, and will not upload or download it.  This means that it will be your responsibility to keep the folder organized.  I recommend following the SSPI hierarchy, with three folders for the three pillars, nested folders for the categories, and further nested folders for the indicators.  Inside of the indicator folders, you can keep the raw(s) file for the data.\n",

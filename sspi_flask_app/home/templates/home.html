        <h2>Measuring Policy with the SSPI</h2>
        <p>The Sustainable, Shared-Prosperity Policy Index (SSPI) integrates 
        three Pillars  (Sustainability, Market Structure, and Public Goods) 
        that measure the system of national policies  that represent the 
        government functions of protecting the environment, structuring markets, 
        and delivering public goods and services, respectively.  Nations vary widely 
        in their national policies  to provide for the common good and support 
        the well-being of people and the environment.  Although we can point out 
        social goals and compare countries using a variety of outcome or 
        performance indices, to our knowledge no policy index exists that 
        aggregates the policies created  to guide and support these outcomes. 
        For example, metrics compare the economic performance of countries in 
        terms of inequality by race and gender, greenhouse gas emissions and 
        sustainability, health and longevity, education, and productivity, e.g., 
        across all 18 UN  Sustainable Development Goals. We created the SSPI to 
        compare national policies in a way that  provides a road map of how to 
        create the socioeconomic system that generates these goals or outcomes. 
        To see how well SSPI policies track socioeconomic well-being across countries, 
        we analyze the statistical relationship of the SSPI with well-known metrics 
        of national outcomes.  Overall the SSPI rankings allow us to compare how 
        countries vary in their policies in terms of where they are weak or strong, 
        and explore how countries can improve.  </p>
